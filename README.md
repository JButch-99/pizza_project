## Description
_This is a program made to help you order a pizza! You have 2 sections for customization. Toppings, and the size of your crust. You have 10 options for toppings. Split evenly in half, you have 5 toppings for meats, and five toppings for vegan options. For sizes, it ranges from personal to extra large. The first 3 toppings selected, regardless of being meat products or not, are free. However, each topping afterwards is an additional 1.75 charge. The size of the pizza is also different. The cheapest, a personal size, is a mere 4.99, whereas 17.99 is for the extra large size. After inputting your selection, you can press "view order" in order to see your receipt, and total charge for you._
